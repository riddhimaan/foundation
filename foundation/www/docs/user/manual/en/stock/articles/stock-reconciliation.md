#Reconciliation Entry

A Stock Item has been purchased and stored in a warehouse. With time there is a change in valuation because of various factors. It can go up or down in value because of deterioration of quality/marking to market price or change in price of a fungible commodity. 

You can post a reconciliation entry for the stock item via [Stock Reconciliation](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/opening-stock.html) Entry.

####Step 1:

In the Attachment file, fill in the appropriate columns;

- **Item Code** whose value is to be revalued.
- **Warehouse** in which item is stored.
- **Qty (Quantity)** Leave this column blank.
- **Valuation Rate** will be item's value after revaluation.

After updating Valuation Rate for an item, come back to Stock Reconciliation and upload save .csv file.

####Step 2:

Select an account from COA for recording the difference in value in **Difference Account**. Value booked in the difference account will be the difference of old and new valuation rate of the item, which will be actually the difference amount.
